How the JVM Works
Compilation:

Java source code is written in .java files.
The javac compiler converts this source code into bytecode, stored in .class files.
Class Loading:

The JVM loads .class files through the Class Loader subsystem.
The class loader ensures that classes are loaded into memory only when they are required.
Bytecode Verification:

The bytecode verifier checks the bytecode to ensure it's valid and adheres to JVM specifications. This step ensures security and prevents malicious code execution.
Execution Engine:

The JVM executes the bytecode using the Execution Engine.
It can either use an Interpreter (line-by-line execution) or a Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler, which converts bytecode into native machine code for faster execution.
Memory Management:

The JVM manages memory through different areas:
Heap: For objects and class instances.
Stack: For method execution and local variables.
Method Area: For class metadata and static fields.
Program Counter Register: Tracks the address of the next instruction to execute.
Native Method Stack: For native methods.
Garbage Collection:

The JVM automatically manages memory cleanup by identifying and removing unused objects, ensuring efficient memory use.
Example Java Code
Hereâ€™s an example Java program and an explanation of its execution:

java
Copy code
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, JVM!");
        int result = add(10, 20);
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }

    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
Step-by-Step Execution
Compilation:

javac HelloWorld.java compiles the code into HelloWorld.class.
Class Loading:

The JVM loads HelloWorld.class into memory using the Class Loader.
Bytecode Verification:

The bytecode verifier checks that the bytecode adheres to JVM standards.
Execution:

The main method is executed first.
The System.out.println statement is interpreted or compiled by the JIT compiler and prints "Hello, JVM!" to the console.
The add method is called, computes 10 + 20, and returns 30.
Garbage Collection:

After execution, unused objects (if any) are removed from memory by the Garbage Collector.
